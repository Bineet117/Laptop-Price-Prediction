## Introduction
This project uses machine learning to predict laptop prices based on brand, specifications, and market trends. It helps stakeholders make informed decisions on purchasing, pricing, inventory management, and product development.



## Problem Statement
The laptop market is influenced by brand reputation, hardware specifications, demand, and technological advancements, making price forecasting complex. Traditional methods often lack precision and adaptability. A data-driven approach using machine learning can develop robust predictive models for accurate laptop price forecasts, improving our understanding and adaptation to market dynamics.
